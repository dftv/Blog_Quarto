    "text": "It’s pretty easy to keep a team organized with a well-defined workflow, right?\nBut if you want to showcase your incompetence or simply watch everything go up in flames, this post is for you!\nAlready in a leadership position and ready to swim against the tide? Here are some tips to quickly turn everything upside down, bringing chaos and demotivation as fast as possible to everyone relying on your work.\nAnd the best part:\nTo better understand where you can fail and make it blatantly obvious to everyone, let’s break down the following workflow I’ve created:\nflowchart TB;\n  T1[\n    By optimizing with AI processes like:\n  ]\n\n  subgraph G1[ ]\n    G1.1[\n      Sending corporate messages\n      or emails\n    ]\n\n    G1.2[\n      Problem-solving\n    ]\n\n    G1.3[Task delegation]\n\n    G1.4[Decision-making]\n  end\n\n  subgraph G2[ ]\n    subgraph G2.1[ ]\n      direction TB\n\n      G2.1.1[Lack of empathy and social skills]\n      G2.1.2[Lack of contextual awareness]\n      G2.1.3[Ignoring feedback]\n      G2.1.4[Ineffective communication]\n\n      G2.1.1 --&gt; G2.1.2\n      G2.1.2 --&gt; G2.1.3\n      G2.1.3 --&gt; G2.1.4\n    end\n\n    subgraph G2.2[ ]\n      direction TB\n\n      G2.2.1[Technical superficiality]\n      G2.2.2[Lack of active leadership]\n      G2.2.3[Impersonal decisions with no relevant contextual basis]\n      G2.2.4[Inability to solve problems]\n\n      G2.2.1 --&gt; G2.2.2\n      G2.2.2 --&gt; G2.2.3\n      G2.2.3 --&gt; G2.2.4\n    end\n\n    subgraph G2.3[ ]\n      direction TB\n\n      G2.3.1[Technical superficiality]\n      G2.3.2[Lack of understanding of internal processes and business rules]\n      G2.3.3[Neglect of organization and planning]\n      G2.3.4[Inefficiency in delegating tasks]\n\n      G2.3.1 --&gt; G2.3.2\n      G2.3.2 --&gt; G2.3.3\n      G2.3.3 --&gt; G2.3.4\n    end\n\n    subgraph G2.4[ ]\n      direction TB\n\n      G2.4.1[Lack of active leadership]\n      G2.4.2[Ignoring feedback and human factors]\n      G2.4.3[Neglect of organization and planning]\n      G2.4.4[Inability to make assertive decisions]\n\n      G2.4.1 --&gt; G2.4.2\n      G2.4.2 --&gt; G2.4.3\n      G2.4.3 --&gt; G2.4.4\n    end\n  end\n\n  subgraph G3[ ]\n    G3.1[Loss of trust in leadership]\n    G3.2[Doubt about your expertise]\n    G3.3[Increase in mistakes and rework]\n    G3.4[Internal conflicts between teams and departments]\n  end\n\n  T2[Demotivated and unproductive work environment]\n\n  T1 --&gt;  G1.1 & G1.2 & G1.3 & G1.4\n\n  G1.1 -- You demonstrate --&gt; G2.1\n  G1.2 -- You demonstrate --&gt; G2.2\n  G1.3 -- You demonstrate --&gt; G2.3\n  G1.4 -- You demonstrate --&gt; G2.4\n\n  G2.1 -- Leading to --&gt; G3.1\n  G2.2 -- Leading to --&gt; G3.2\n  G2.3 -- Leading to --&gt; G3.3\n  G2.4 -- Leading to --&gt; G3.4\n\n  G3.1 & G3.2 & G3.3 & G3.4 -- Resulting in --&gt; T2\nSee how easy it is to visualize how simple processes can trigger a chain of problems that will inevitably lead to your undeniable exclusion and eventual termination?\nMaybe you felt personally attacked by how this topic was introduced.\nIf so, part of that is due to the Psychological Reactance phenomenon2 combined with elements of Reverse Psychology3.\nBy deliberately exaggerating the impact of the indiscriminate use of this miraculous tool4 — framing as “correct” something that is generally frowned upon—you, as the likely target audience, are naturally inclined to resist and deny it. After all, how hard is it to admit that what currently makes you a professional could easily be the nightmare of many of your colleagues? Or worse, that you could be replaced by an inanimate tool?\nThis negative reaction from this category of workers is expected since they are already dependent on this enabler5, and the idea that it might be harmful—not just to them but to everyone around them—doesn’t fit the short-term results they have experienced so far.\nFrom a broader perspective, part of the blame may not be entirely yours but rather the fault of those who sold you the idea that this tool6 is the solution to all your monotonous tasks. However, the lack of supervision and limitation of its use will always lead to its application in a wide range of areas—without proper impact assessment and consideration of consequences—far beyond the monotonous tasks it was originally designed for7.\nCurrently, most AI models are in constant development and far from their peak, with limitations and flaws that are imperceptible at first glance. This is because their entire functioning is designed to socially please the user, meaning they are structured in a way that prevents you from feeling like you’re facing incorrect or nonsensical information.\nNot convinced? Maybe you’re still caught in Automation Bias8. To open your eyes, here are some phenomena that might be happening to you daily without you even realizing it:\nIn conclusion, the use of AI tools in corporate environments should be approached with caution and always under the supervision of a qualified professional. After all, no tool can replace critical thinking and assertive decision-making—no matter how convincing or convenient it may seem.\nI hope this reading has helped you open your eyes to the dangers of so-called “miracle” automation tools, both for current AI and for future technologies that may emerge."
